ifupdown2
=========

ifupdown2 is a alternate implementation of debian's network interface manager
ifupdown.

ifupdown2 provides the required infrastructure to parse, schedule and
manage interface configuration. Also provides default python addon modules
for network interface configuration.


Note: Previously ifupdown2 came as two packages: python-ifupdown2 and
python-ifupdown2-addons. python-ifupdown2-addons contents are now merged into
python-ifupdown2 package (python-ifupdown2-addons package is hence deprecated).
